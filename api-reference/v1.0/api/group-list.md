# List groups
List all the groups available in an organization, including but not limited to Office 365 Groups.

This operation returns by default only a subset of the properties for each group. These default properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/group.md#properties) section. 

To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET](group-get.md) operation for the group and specify the properties in a `select` OData query option. See an [example](group-get.md#request-2).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /groups
```

## Optional query parameters
To list only Office 365 Groups (aka unified groups), apply a filter on **groupTypes**:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups?$filter=groupTypes/any(c:c+eq+'Unified')
```

You can use the OData query option `$orderby` to sort groups in an organization by the **displayName**
values, as shown in the following example:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups?$orderby=displayName
```

For more information on OData query options, see [OData Query Parameters](/graph/query-parameters).
